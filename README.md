# Rutva Pandya - Academic Portfolio

My personal academic website built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Local Development

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Visit `http://localhost:4000` to view locally.

## Updating Content

- Edit `index.md` for homepage updates
- Update `about.md` with your background
- Add content to other pages as you progress

## Deployment

Push to main branch - GitHub Pages will automatically build and deploy.
