## About Me

I am a passionate **Software Engineering** student with expertise in **Natural Language Processing** and **Machine Learning**. Currently pursuing my degree at [Your University], I specialize in building intelligent systems and exploring the intersection of language and computation.

I have experience working with **Python, JavaScript, and modern web technologies**, and have contributed to projects in **NLP research and web development**. I'm particularly interested in **transformer models, sentiment analysis, and conversational AI**.

When I'm not coding, you can find me **reading research papers, contributing to open source projects, and exploring new technologies**. I'm always eager to learn and collaborate on exciting research projects.
